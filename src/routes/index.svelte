		headline="(AWS) Creating CD for an App"
		text="To create a CI we first have to know which steps need to 
     be executed for updating the production-server with the newest 
     code from the development-server.
     For that we first do all steps manually. We assume that the dev 
     made some last changes on the dev-server. After that the dev 
     executes 'npm run build' to finally check if the code is valid 
     and able to run. Then the dev continues with 'git add .', then 
     'git commit -m 'message'', then 'git push'.
     .....
     Now on the production-server the dev executes 'git pull'. 
     After this the dev needs to deploy the svelte-App via 'npm run build'
      on the production-server to get the latest build-files. 
      Before we can deploy these latest build-files we need to kill 
      the process on the specific port 3005 with the command 
      'fuser -k 3005/tcp'.
      After killing the port-blocking-process we can deploy the 
      new build files.
      These build files need to get executed with node in the 
      background and to a specific port via 'PORT=3005 node index.js &'.
      Now the production-server is up-to-date with the dev server and 
     the latest content is running in the WebApp on the actual domain.
      ...
      All of that worked quite well and successfully.
      So all we need to do is writing all these commands 
      (on the production-server) into an executable 
      '.sh-file' and letting it get executed ca. hourly via crontab:
      1. git pull
      2. npm run build
      3. fuser -k 3005/tcp

  and I texted some people beforehand. I was lucky and found someone.
  So some days before I bought a bottle 'Berliner Luft' as a gift.
On Friday (sometime around noon) I jumped out of the 
university building and into the S-Bahn to get to the 
busstation fast (other side of the city).
Made it on time and could  lay back and enjoy the ride.
Berlin -> Warsaw.. it took around 6-8h.
So I arrived in Warsaw very late.. around 10pm at bus/train station Warschau West (Warszawa Zachodnia).
Now the local public transport bus to my host. 
He lived close to Åazienki-Park... It was exactly at the 
big intersection south-east of the park.
When I arrived I asked him how to open the door. 
He gave me the number code. I unsuccessfully tried to open the door 
 and told him it didnt work. 
He came down from his flat and tried it by himself...
Of course it worked now :D....
Anyways its 11pm now and he shows me around the flat and tells me about the town, 
what to do and how to get around...
I give him my gift from Berlin and he is really happy about it - so worth it:)
Also he has an own room for visitors/Couchsurfers.
So we go sleeping because he has to get up at 5am and I have to get out of the flat with him.
Good night....<br><br>
Next morning at 4:sth am we get up and ready to leave... 
Its still dark ofc and im tired and cold..
What can I do at 5am??
I decide to go to the city-center. Tried to take a public bus... But unfortunately - unlike the busses in Berlin - 
they dont open the doors automatically when somebody is waiting at the bus station.
I didnt know that for the first try and stupidly waited at the closed door. 
The driver didnt really feel like caring and just continued on his journey without asking what was wrong with me....
So the second public bus I noticed the green buttons at the bus' front door.
Now i could open and finally take the bus to the city center. :)
The bus didnt bring me exactl to my final destination.
I continued walking... On my way I came across the soldiers
at the grave of the unknown soldier. The flame was burning. 
I was alone with the two soldiers keeping watch.
It started getting dawn.
Now a van arrived at the square and a guy put some of these new electrical 
scooters next to me. I thought 'ok, lets do try this out.'.
Here we go. But first I needed to install some apps and register
a payment method... I didnt have a creditcard back then... But paypal worked luckily.. or sort of..
The payment didnt go through but the scooter got unlocked while the payment was on hold or sth...
So lets go to the center finally.. I arrive a the big square with the column and stop the scooter.
It gets locked and in the app I see that I dont get a second chance.
The payment didnt work and now I owe them 0,60â¬. Fuck. 
Anyways... Lets leave the scooter behind and walk around.
Its still really cold but luckily the morning sun perfectly starts flowing over the square.
I keep standing in the warm sun for a bit.
Around me only very few people are awake.
<br><br>
Also on couchsurfing I was texting with a girl I asked for a couch.
She said no to the couch but yes to meeting up.
We met for a so called FREE TOUR. You only give a donation after the tour - if you like.
The tours meet (of course) at the column. Then we went around the old town and next to the old city-wall.
