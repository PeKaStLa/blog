     For that we first do all steps manually. We assume that the dev made some last changes on the dev-server. After that the dev executes 'git add .', then 'git commit -m 'message'', then 'git push'.
     Now on the production-server the dev executes 'git pull'. After this the dev needs to deploy the svelte-App on the production-server to get the latest build-files.

Ubuntu is partly based on 'Debian', uses the Advanced Package Tool (APT)-software-manager.

    But what if you want to host more than one Application? Do you need to pay for a second EC2-machine? One server and one domain for every project?
    With a webserver-software like 'nginx' it's possible to host multiple apps on different sub-domains on one single server.

        text="When you buy a domain at AWS your first hosted zone gets generated automatically. Later I deleted this hosted zone to save some money on AWS-fees during a long travel. After coming home from the vacation I didn't remember much about the orignal hosted zone. I just created a new hosted zone and added the records for simple routing to the www-domain and the short domain-name. After starting the EC2-Server and installing nginx - there was nothing to see on my domain. So I tried reaching my public-IP. Luckily there I could see the 'Welcome to nginx!'-Page. So where is the error in this? After some searching I found out that the nameservers of the new hosted zone are different to the ones of the domain. I copied all of the four nameservers from the hosted zone and pasted them into the records of the domain. Instead of the notified 24 hours it just took 2 or 3 minutes to apply the changes. Now everything worked as it should. The domain and the public-IP showed the same page."

 No worries, you can fit all this in a 20L-backpack. I tried it and did it before. A small backpack will make your whole backpacking-life much easier and make your trip more relaxed.
