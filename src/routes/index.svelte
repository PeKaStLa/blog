   So the first step is to add the repository manually to '/etc/yum.repos.d'.

   Now you just need to install that the normal way.
  
  1. Add jenkins-repository to yum

		text="On Amazon Linux 2023 and Amazon Linux 2 there 
     there are many softwares missing like mariaDB, 
     postgresql, node, npm.
     
     
     <br><br>
  For node and npm for example, we need to first add
  the node.js repository and install it after:
  <br><br>
  1. curl -fsSL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo bash -
 <br>
  2. sudo yum install -y nodejs
<br>
<br><br>
I also downloaded the sourcecode of postgresql 
manually. First download the file with curl and 
second unzip it with tar:
<br><br>
1. curl --output postgresql-15.3.tar.bz2 https://ftp. postgresql.org /pub/source/v15.3 /postgresql -15.3.tar.bz2
<br>
2. tar xf postgresql-15.3.tar.bz2

     fail. Also when you use the node-command with '&' to run it without 
     output, the command still requires a 'ENTER' to return to the bash-commandline.
     So the way to do it is using tmux. First we create a new detached tmux session.
     Then we send the node-command to the created tmux-session and confirm the 
     command with adding 'ENTER' in the command.  
     <br>

     1. command: 'tmux new-session -d -s blog'

		headline="(AWS) Creating CD for an App"
		text="To create a CI we first have to know which steps need to 
     be executed for updating the production-server with the newest 
     code from the development-server.
     For that we first do all steps manually. We assume that the dev 
     made some last changes on the dev-server. After that the dev 
     executes 'npm run build' to finally check if the code is valid 
     and able to run. Then the dev continues with 'git add .', then 
     'git commit -m 'message'', then 'git push'.
     .....
     Now on the production-server the dev executes 'git pull'. 
     After this the dev needs to deploy the svelte-App via 'npm run build'
      on the production-server to get the latest build-files. 
      Before we can deploy these latest build-files we need to kill 
      the process on the specific port 3005 with the command 
      'fuser -k 3005/tcp'.
      After killing the port-blocking-process we can deploy the 
      new build files.
      These build files need to get executed with node in the 
      background and to a specific port via 'PORT=3005 node index.js &'.
      Now the production-server is up-to-date with the dev server and 
     the latest content is running in the WebApp on the actual domain.
      ...
      All of that worked quite well and successfully.
      So all we need to do is writing all these commands 
      (on the production-server) into an executable 
      '.sh-file' and letting it get executed ca. hourly via crontab:
      1. git pull
      2. npm run build
      3. fuser -k 3005/tcp
      4. PORT=3005 node index.js &

Via the command 'fuser 3005/tcp' we get the process-ID of the process 
which is running on and blocking the Port 3005.
With the command 'fuser -k 3005/tcp' we are killing this process.

    But what if you want to host more than one Application? Do you need to pay for a second EC2-machine? One server and one domain for every project?
    With a webserver-software like 'nginx' it's possible to host multiple apps on different sub-domains on one single server. 
    ...
    Also I want to seperate the different nginx.config-snippets into 
    seperate files so that I can edit them easier for CD without any

		text="When you buy a domain at AWS your first hosted zone gets generated automatically. Later I deleted this hosted zone to save some money on AWS-fees during a long travel. After coming home from the vacation I didn't remember much about the orignal hosted zone. I just created a new hosted zone and added the records for simple routing to the www-domain and the short domain-name. After starting the EC2-Server and installing nginx - there was nothing to see on my domain. So I tried reaching my public-IP. Luckily there I could see the 'Welcome to nginx!'-Page. So where is the error in this? After some searching I found out that the nameservers of the new hosted zone are different to the ones of the domain. I copied all of the four nameservers from the hosted zone and pasted them into the records of the domain. Instead of the notified 24 hours it just took 2 or 3 minutes to apply the changes. Now everything worked as it should. The domain and the public-IP showed the same page."
